# converto

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Flutter app development then visit below links:-

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

In this project I have used an API which do not require API key and it is safe and better. Link ```https://exchangeratesapi.io/```

Steps to begin:
- First Star the project as it motivates us to build more projects
- Fork the repository into your account
- If you want don't want to build apk then directly run it on your emulator or mobile using USB debugging
- If you want to build apk and then try it then:
  - First do ```flutter clean``` in the terminal of project
  - Then do ```flutter build apk --split-per-abi``` as it will produce an apk of small size which saves time
  - After the apk build is done then install the app and run it

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
